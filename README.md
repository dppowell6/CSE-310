# CSE-310
projects for CSE 310
This project has two major goals:
1.  The first is to implement various sorting and selection algorithms.
2.  The second is to run experiments comparing the performance of certain algorithms, to collect and plot
data, and to interpret the results.
Note:
This project is to be completed
individually
.  Your implementation
must
use C/C++ and ulti-
mately your code
must
run on the Linux machine
general.asu.edu
.
All dynamic memory allocation
must
be done yourself, i.e., using either
malloc()
and
free()
, or
new()
and
delete()
.  You may not use any external libraries to implement any part of this project.  The use of
string functions, e.g.,
strcat
,
strcmp
, is allowed.
See
ยง
2 for the milestone and full project requirements.  Scripts will be used to check the correctness of
your program.  Therefore, absolutely no changes to these project requirements are permitted.
You should use a version control system as you develop your solution to this project, e.g., GitHub.  Your
code repository must be
private
to prevent anyone from plagiarizing your work.
